## **PROBLEM**
Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

**SOLUTION**
SOLUTION 1:
```
SELECT max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary 
FROM Employee
WHERE salary not in (SELECT max(salary)
                    FROM employee)
```                    
SOLUTION 2:
```
SELECT DISTINCT
    Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM
    Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
```
