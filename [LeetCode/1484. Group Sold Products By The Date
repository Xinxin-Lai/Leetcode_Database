## **PROBLEM**
Table Activities:

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| sell_date   | date    |
| product     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contains duplicates.
Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.
 

Write an SQL query to find for each date, the number of distinct products sold and their names.

The sold-products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically. 

Return the result table ordered by sell_date.

The query result format is in the following example.

Activities table:
+------------+-------------+
| sell_date  | product     |
+------------+-------------+
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone   |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball  |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible       |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt     |
+------------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by comma.
For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by comma.
For 2020-06-02, Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.

**SOLUTION**
 ···
SELECT sell_date, count(DISTINCT product) num_sold, group_concat(DISTINCT product) products
FROM Activities
GROUP BY sell_date
ORDER BY sell_date;
···

##**GROUP_CONCAT vs. CONCAT**
CONCAT() or CONCAT_WS() are used for concatinating differents values of multiple columns within the same row, while gorup_concat() joins together
values from differnt rows within the same column. By default, returns a string covering the whole result set.
